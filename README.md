# ONLY FOR ASUS A456U
EFI for those who needs a base start for their OpenCore journey.

My laptop specs:

Intel i5-7200u 2.71 GHz

Intel HD 620 (Nvidia GeForce 930mx isn’t supported)

Soldered 4GB 2133mhz + 4GB Apacer 2133mhz (Total 8GB)

Elan 1200 Touchpad

Apacer 240GB SSD

Atheros AR9565 (isn’t supported so I’ll change the wifi card soon)

Everything works except wifi, bluetooth, and the brightness keys(fn+f5/f6)
The touchpad also support gestures
